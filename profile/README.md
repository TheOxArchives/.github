# The Ox Archives

Project Fairness Labs hosts this organization.

Because of this image below (and the reaction from some people), we've decided to create The Ox Archives as a way for you to still get your OverExtended resources for FiveM such as OxLib and OxMySQL.

This is in no way to attack the people over at OverExtended. This is an archive, should the resources be deleted in the near future.
